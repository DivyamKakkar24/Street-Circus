    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Halo: Combat Evolved is the game that sparked a beloved Microsoft franchise and put the original Xbox on the map. It reimagined the first-person shooter (FPS) genre for consoles and popularized many of the controls and functions that such games would use for decades afterward. Halo received an enhanced remake in 2011 for the Xbox 360 (Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary) that featured updated graphics and a toggle function that lets you swap between Classic and Remastered visual styles.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      As part of the new Master Chief Collection, the updated Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary boasts 4K graphics, ultrawide monitor support, and other features you'd expect from a contemporary PC game. It's an outstanding remastering, one that only suffers from niggling audio and visual issues.

    <h2>2. Battlefield V</h2>

    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2018 | Developer: Dice, Criterion</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Battlefield V doesn't drastically alter the first-person-shooter field, but what's in this package is quite good. The EA DICE-developed game features a gorgeous World War II scenario and lightning-fast gameplay that'll keep you running and shooting for hours on end.</p><br>
    <p>
      Battlefield V encompasses all the hallmarks of a modern first-person shooter by including respectable singleplayer content (War Stories) and fresh takes on multiplayer gameplay (Grand Operations). Firestorm, the game's squad-based battle royale mode, supports up to 64 players, putting the series' signature environmental destruction on display in glorious fashion.

    <h2>3. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h2>
    <div class="gunpic csgo">
      <img src="images/fpsgames/csgo.jpg" alt="Counter-Strike: Global Offensive" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2012 | Developer: Valve, Hidden Path Entertainment</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Valve's free-to-play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive(AKA CS: GO) is one of the most iconic titles of its generation. Buoyed by a strong FPS heritage that includes the original Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source, CS:GO is a fast-paced first-person shooter from 2012 that still holds its own against contemporary titles.</p><br>
    <p>
      Sure, CS: GO is starting to show its age in certain areas, particularly in regards to the somewhat dated visual design, but the incredibly active community offers a highly competitive esports scene.

    <h2>4. Doom (2016)</h2>
    <div class="gunpic doom">
      <img src="images/fpsgames/doom.jpg" alt="Doom (2016)" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2016 | Developer: id Software</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">No, this isn't the classic, genre-defining 1993 original. This is Doom, the numberless 2016 series entry that exceeded many gamers' expectations. You once again play as the armed-to-the-teeth Doom Slayer who battles Hell's minions on Mars. As a result, goat-legged skeleton men, flying, flaming skulls, and other monstrous hordes assault you from every side.</p><br>
    <p>
      Featuring gory, frantic, demon-blasting gameplay and a blood-pumping heavy metal soundtrack, the id Software-crafted Doom blends old-school design with modern know-how to form a satisfying, unholy concoction.

    <h2>5. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</h2>
    <div class="gunpic cod">
      <img src="images/fpsgames/CODmw.jpg" alt="Call of Duty: Modern Warfare" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2019 | Developer: Infinity Ward</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The Call of Duty franchise has been all over the place in recent years, with a focus shift from WWII campaigns to space adventures to battle royale action. Although Call of Duty has strayed from its roots, the Infinity Ward-developed reboot of the seminal 2007 title grounds the first-person shooter series.</p><br>
    <p>
      Modern Warfare has the tactical single-player and robust multiplayer modes one expects from a Call of Duty title, but successfully strips away all superfluous elements. That's not to say that Modern Warfare lacks cool features. New to the game is a rewards-based morality system that ranks your ability to properly discern innocent people from legitimate threats in the singleplayer campaign.

    <h2>6. Halo: Reach</h2>
    <div class="gunpic halor">
      <img src="images/fpsgames/haloreach.jpg" alt="Halo: Reach" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2010 | Developer: Bungie</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Halo is one of the most iconic shooter series to appear in the past few console generations, one that delivers fast-paced action, excellent sci-fi drama, and addicting multiplayer gameplay. Sure, Call of Duty and Battlefield have their doggedly committed fans, and Doom may very well have reclaimed its first-person-shooter crown with 2016's release, but Halo and its sequels (particularly Halo: Reach) have a special place in many hearts.</p><br>
    <p>
      The newly remastered Halo: Reach—a part of the Halo: Master Chief Collection compilation that bundles and updates every mainline Halo release, sans Halo 5—represents the first time the shooter has appeared on PC. The game now offers 4K graphics, ultrawide monitor support, and other expected PC-related extras that weren't in the Xbox 360 original. The cumbersome UI and annoying audio issues do detract, however.

    <h2>7. Titanfall 2</h2>
    <div class="gunpic titan">
      <img src="images/fpsgames/titan2.jpg" alt="Titanfall 2" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2016 | Developer: Respawn Entertainment</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Titanfall 2 is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. A sequel to 2014's Titanfall, it is more refined and polished.</p><br>
    <p>
      Somehow Titanfall 2's campaign ended up being the star of the show for us, despite a host of high-value multiplayer options as well. Development of the game's single-player was treated like a game jam of sorts, where different members of the team would pitch their ideas for what a singleplayer Titanfall 2 idea level look like. The end result brings a really curious mix of thrilling platforming challenges, one-off level-changing tools and even puzzle elements, alongside BT, a charming mech pal who's like having a giant talking metal dog.
