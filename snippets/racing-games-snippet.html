    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">With significantly better performance on lesser hardware than Horizon 3, more intuitive and social multiplayer features, and an ever-changing map that shifts to a new season every week, Forza Horizon 4 manages to improve on a near perfect arcade racing game. It's not for simulation fanatics, but for anyone with a passing interest in cars and/or driving them off of mountains, Horizon 4 is a must-play.</p><br>
    <p>In Phil's review of Forza Horizon 4, he's still smitten with the excellent, adaptable vehicle handling: "The racing remains peerless. It's a perfect blend of forgiving arcade handling with an obsessive attention to detail that ensures each car feels just different enough. It's not aiming to be a perfect simulation, but the weight, speed and torque of each vehicle give it a personality beyond class and category."</p>

    <h2>2. Burnout Paradise Remastered</h2>

    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2018 | Developer: Criterion</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Racing games aren't often treated to remasters. The big franchises iterate so often that there rarely seems much point, but in the case of Burnout Paradise everybody was happy to see an exception to the rule. In 10 years, there's been nothing quite like it.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Paradise isn't an online "social" experience. It's not all about collectibles and unlocks. You get new cars, but they're not the point of the game. It's about driving around a city populated entirely by cars, listening to a drivetime DJ spin classic and pop rock tracks while you drive hell-for-leather through twisting city streets, mountain passes, and idyllic farmland. It's violent, blindingly fast, and endlessly entertaining. It's created the modern arcade racing genre, but the joke is on us, because all we've done ever since is try to get back to Paradise.

    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2012 | Developer: Criterion</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">If you’re not that big of a fan of customization and just want to indulge yourself in fast races around a highly destructible city, Need for Speed: Most Wanted is the one for you. It sets itself apart from the 2005 entry of the same game and instead looks to provide the mayhem that is akin to the Burnout games, with the cop chasing that we all have grown to love from this series. As an interesting feature, there’s no menus or lobbies. You can access everything on the fly without letting your hands off the wheel, making Most Wanted one of the most straightforward and intense experiences in this list.</p>

    <h2>4. Project CARS 2</h2>
    <div class="carpic pro">
      <img src="images/Racinggames/cars2.jpg" alt="Project CARS 2" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2017 | Developer: Slightly Mad Studios</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">This is the racing sim that attempts to do it all: ice racing on studded tires around Swedish snowdrifts. Karting in the Scottish highlands. Rallycross within Hockenheim’s infield section, mud splattering across everything and everyone. LMP1s hurtling through Imola, Indycars defying gravity at Daytona Speedway - and when you really get bored, Honda Civics trying to make it up Eau Rouge without stalling. </p><br>
    <p>
      More miraculous than the sheer breadth of content in Slightly Mad’s sim sequel is the fact they pull it all off. Loose surface racing feels just as convincing as hitting the track in a road-legal car, and the fidelity it conveys to your hands as you try to bully a car into the apex with its force feedback support is best-in-class stuff. Several racing drivers across numerous disciplines acted as consultants during development, and it really does show. A strong eSports scene is now solidified around Project CARS 2, and such is the depth of simulation that for young aspiring drivers, this might well be a fitting substitute for time on track.

    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2012 | Developer: Bugbear Entertainment</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">This entry, crafted by Bugbear Entertainment, brings a chaotic element to the familiar gameplay by adding environmental and vehicular destruction as you race for street cred in the fictional Shatter Bay. It's Ridge Racer gone full Burnout.</p><br>
    <p>
      Shatter Bay's many districts are high-detailed and destructible locations that entice you to race one more match. When you fire up Ridge Racer Unbounded, you can only select one car and race district, but others are unlocked as you accumulate collateral damage points. These points are gathered by plowing through anything other than a solid brick wall.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      The story is something you can flat out ignore—it's a racing game, after all—but the driving action is interesting and varied. Just play against human opponents if you wish to maintain your sanity.

    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2010 | Developer: Criterion</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Hot Pursuit is a driving game frozen in a particularly special time for arcade racers. The purest essence of Need for Speed before the series went all open-world, it delivers exactly what the title promises, in race after race, with no downtime. Enjoy the simple life as you aim a European exotic down a stretch of hauntingly beautiful Pacific coast highway with a train of police cars following in your wake.</p><br>
    <p>
      It's aged like an oak-smoked A-lister too. The roadside textures and car poly counts might not be able to compete directly with the latest releases, but the overall aesthetic in Hot Pursuit still looks luxurious. And above all, fast.

    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2010 | Developer: Black Rock Studio</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Welcome to the Michael Bay Motorsports Hour, where fake sports cars will rocket through desolate, orange-filtered urban wastelands at blinding speed while drivers accumulate enough energy to trigger bomb-drops from overhead helicopters, vicious sweeps from out-of-control cranes, and even the odd explosion of an entire city block.</p><br>
    <p>
      Nearly 10 years on, Split/Second remains the perfect chaser to a lot of open-world arcade racers: it's laser-focused on absurd automotive chaos and increasingly improbable tableaus of bloodless mechanical carnage.
