    <h2>1. Thimbleweed Park</h2>

    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2017 | Developer: Terrible Toybox</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      While Day of the Tentacle is the official sequel to Maniac Mansion, Thimbleweed Park – from adventure veterans Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick – feels like the authentic sequel; one where you get to explore the Mansion but also the surrounding area and local town. The weird, weird town.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Thimbleweed Park is one of the best adventure and retro games around not just because it feels like a forgotten LucasArts classic or love letter to the company’s adventures; it feels like a worthy update. Developers Terrible Toybox keep Thimbleweed Park looking and feeling authentically retro, with chunky pixel art and huge verb buttons, but cleverly add to the genre, too. For example, there are random events that may or may not happen as you explore as one of the five playable characters. Wandering into a deserted alleyway, apropos of nothing, could see a character get abducted. Then there are more puzzles to solve before you get them back.

    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2010 | Developer: Remedy Entertainment</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Alan Wake... Just the name alone gives off creepy, supernatural and literary vibes. Alan Wake is a wonderfully crafted game from Remedy Entertainment, who created the two Max Payne games before Wake, and also the creators of the hit-or-miss Quantum Break, and the phenomenal Control.

      This game is written so well, the atmosphere is fantastic, the lip syncing kind of flops, but everything else still holds up decently in the game and aged decently. Not to mention also it's underrated musical score that is just fantastic, beautiful, and moody that it can give you the chills and a sense of nostalgia.

    <h2>3. A Way Out</h2>

      <img src="images/adventuregames/wayout.jpg" alt="A Way Out" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2018 | Developer: Hazelight</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      If single-player adventures aren’t for you, not to worry - A Way Out is here to ensure that those that favour split-screen offerings still get the chance to engage in the high-stakes campaigns that solo players often get to sink their teeth into. Opening in a prison in the 1970s, A Way Out urges a player and their partner to work together effectively to plot their escape from incarceration. It’s an inventive set-up, in which players must work with one another smartly if they are to make any kind of progress - at some point, one player will have to create a distraction so that the other can pick up an object that will aid them in their escape plan. By the end of the game, the two players helping the protagonists Leo and Vincent to go on the run will become as close as the characters they’re controlling and may even shed a tear or two as the story nears its conclusion.

    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2008 | Developer: Capcom</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition takes everything that made Capcom's original 2008 release an impressive action game and expands on it. The game includes the Legendary Dark Knight enemy horde mode that was added to the original PC port, as well as three new playable characters, improved visuals, and subtle gameplay tweaks. Some of the weaker aspects of the original release, such as the repetitive story campaign, remain and slightly tarnish an otherwise brilliantly polished title. Overall, Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition is a rock-solid action game that is well worth picking up for fans of the series and action buffs alike.

    <h2>5. The Walking Dead: Season One</h2>
    <div class="adpic walkd">
      <img src="images/adventuregames/walkd.jpg" alt="The Walking Dead: Season One" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2012 | Developer: Telltale Games</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      The stellar first season for Telltale’s most popular series remains its best despite fierce competition. Tales From The Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us both come close, but neither have the magnetism of The Walking Dead’s Lee and Clementine. Good-hearted lawbreaker Lee and recently orphaned Clementine establish a fiercely loyal bond as they weather an onslaught of tragedies and disasters. Chief among these is the zombie apocalypse, of course, but the agendas of every survivor they meet both help and hinder the pair, too.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Telltale’s ability to convince the player that they are in charge of the story – despite the whole thing being a smoke and mirrors act – is what makes The Walking Dead: Season One one of the best adventure games on PC. Scenes play out differently, certain characters can survive longer, and Lee can behave like an absolute dick. The main plot ploughs on but it can feel wildly different depending on who is steering it. For the shocking end of Episode 4 alone, it is a modern classic of a point-and-click game. And, speaking of conclusions, here’s hoping we see an end to the Clem’s narrative season one so expertly kicked off with The Walking Dead: The Final Season.

    </div>
    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2015 | Developer: Dontnod Entertainment</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Developers Dontnod managed the seemingly impossible with Life is Strange: they out Telltale’ed Telltale. Life is Strange boasts consequential choices, a better-looking and more expressive graphics engine, and, most importantly, an entirely original setting.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Main character Max Caulfield is a photography senior, working with classic Polaroid cameras, while everyone else sports expensive top-of-the-range digital gear. She is immediately endearing, appealingly weird, and… has the ability to rewind time. It is a testament to Dontnod team’s writing skills that this game-changing superpower is the least impressive thing about Life is Strange; Max’s relationship with former best friend Chloe, and how they reconnect after Max ran out on that life, is the heart of a story that puts the game in the hallowed company of the best adventure games on PC.

    <span class="release" style="font-style: italic;">Release date: 2018 | Developer: Rockstar Games</span>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      In one of the most ambitious and sprawling games in recent memory, you can strap on outlaw Arthur Morgan’s stirrups and spend hour after hour journeying through the last days of the Western frontier in the company of your trusty horse and a few old friends. In this prequel to the much-loved Red Dead Redemption, weirdly named Red Dead Redemption 2, you find yourself playing as a member of Dutch van der Linde’s legendary gang, alongside a younger version of the original, legendary Red Dead protagonist John Marston, and are able to ride freely across a great American landscape. You are faced with either taking the path of the honourable man as the era of the Wild West approaches its death or spending your days being as terrible an outlaw can be - the choice is yours as you lasso your way through one adventure to the next.
